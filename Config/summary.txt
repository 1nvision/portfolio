Hello, my name is Collin Savall and I am currently a student at the University of California Santa Cruz studying Art Games and Playable Media (AGPM). I have been creating digital art for the past 6 years and have been drawing, creating, sculpting and building for the past 12 years. 

I started out on the paper of my math homework and eventually shifted over to paper along with clay and wood to experient with. In high school I transitioned into the digital world of creativity and have loved it since.
