Hello, my name is Collin Savall and I am currently a student at the University of California Santa Cruz studying Art Games and Playable Media (AGPM). I have been creating digital art for the past 6 years and have been drawing, creating, sculpting and building for the past 12 years. 

I started out on the paper of my math homework and eventually shifted over to paper along with clay and wood to experient with. In high school I transitioned into the digital world of creativity and have loved it since. From editing photos, to video editing, to drawing landscapes and characters from nothing I enjoyed every second of it. Then I got introduced to animation and 3D modeling along with playing more games. Those two interests along with friends who had ideas combined into the passion that I have for creating works and models that can be used for videos, games, or any other creative activity.
